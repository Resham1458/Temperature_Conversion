Objective:
The objective of the project is to write a program which finds out the respective Celsius value of a Fahrenheit temperature entered by the user.

Task: 
1)	Ask the user to enter the temperate in Fahrenheit
2)	Convert the temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius 
3)	Display the temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius to the user
4)	Give the user the option of continuing the program or exiting
 
Assumption: 
The user will input the temperature in Fahrenheit

Formula/Relation used:
Celsius = (Fahrenheit-32) * 5/9

Process: 
1)	User is asked to enter the temperature in Fahrenheit
2)	The temperature in Celsius is displayed
3)	Then user is asked whether he/she wants to continue or exit 
4)	If the user answer is “yes”, then the user is guided following the messages “Go ahead!” and “Please enter the temperature in         Fahrenheit”
5)	If the user answer is “no”, then the program is closed displaying a message “Goodbye!”
